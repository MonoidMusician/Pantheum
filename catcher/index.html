<h1>Catcher in the Rye</h1>
<h2 id="study">Study!</h2>
<section class="pre"><h3>The Ducks in the Central Park Lagoon.</h3>
In Chapter two, when Holden is “shooting the bull” with his history teacher, Mr. Spencer, his mind drifts off and he begins to think of the ducks whose habitat is the lagoon in Central Park South. The ducks are a very important symbol in the novel, because they represent Holden in a way.

<p>He first daydreams about where the ducks in Central Park South go when the lagoon freezes with Mr. Spencer. This is a clear symbol of his uncertainty regarding what his options are after being kicked out of Pencey Prep. He, like the ducks, is being kicked out of his “habitat,” and has nowhere to go for a while. This event foreshadows his crossing of the threshold (thanks middle school), and beginning his journey in the real world.

<p>Later on in the novel, Holden is still very curious about the ducks, so he asks two cab drivers if they know where they go. The first one he asks (chapter 9) thinks that Holden is a “madman” and disregards the question completely. The other one he asks, Horwitz, (chapter 12) is very touchy about the topic and Holden says that he gets very sore about it. Horwitz thinks that the question Holden asks is moronic, and that the fish have it tougher in the wintertime. When Holden asks Horwitz what he thinks the fish do in the wintertime, Horwitz responds that they “just stay there,” and that for food, mother nature takes care of them. Again there is the theme of staying the same and changing. Holden is represented by the ducks, because he is being forced to move; however, he would rather be like the fish: stay where he is and be provided for.

<p>In chapter 20, this motif appears again. It is near the climax of the novel and Holden is nearly at the worst of his troubles. Drunk, he walks to Central Park to see the ducks and if they are there. They are not, and this represents the stage in his journey that Holden is in. He has left the lagoon. At this point in the novel, he can no longer stay in his surroundings and be provided for by mother nature; but he is being forced to “migrate” and mature a little more.
</section>

<section class="pre"><h3>The Mummies</h3>
Holden claims he doesn’t know much about Egyptians in the failing essay he writes for Mr. Spencer’s class, but he knows enough to enthusiastically explain the process of mummification to two younger boys:

<p>“It’s very interesting. They wrapped their faces up in these cloths that were treated with some secret chemical. That way they could be buried in their tombs for thousands of years and their faces wouldn’t rot or anything. Nobody knows how to do it except the Egyptians. Even modern science.” (203)

<p>Notice that Holden doesn’t talk about how they pulled out the organs, or stuck hooks up their noses, or wrapped up their legs or arms; it’s all about the faces, and how the faces wouldn’t rot. To us, it sounds like Holden is a little worried about his own face rotting—metaphorically speaking. He’s afraid of disappearing, of not being noticed: of being just another “faceless” corporate employee, or of being buried and ignored underground like his little brother. But nobody knows how to do that, except the Egyptians, he says.
</section>

<section class="pre"><h3>Mr. Antolini</h3>
Mr. Antolini is the last character the reader encounters. He is, by far, the most insightful character and, as such, is a good way to explain in some of Holden's problems coherently. This coherence is particularly effective as it ties together a number of the themes that have been developed by Holden, albeit through sporadic digressions. Mr. Antolini explains the dangers of hating people, something that Holden is already doing. He also discusses the problems of environments that cannot support a person - this ties in with Holden's preoccupation with the ducks and Central Park. Finally, Mr. Antolini discusses the concept of death.

<p>Because of the unreliability of the narrator, this third-person perspective helps the reader to understand the truth of the situation. But while Holden reports what Mr. Antolini says, he does not follow his advice. Mr. Antolini is also important as he acts as a kind of father figure, as Holden’s real father never appears in the book. This is demonstrated by his link to the Caulfield family and the fact that he was in a position to give advice to D.B.

<p><!--The supposedly sexual advance made by Mr. Antolini is a subject of debate. Some sides will argue that Mr. Antolini is a homosexual, citing the age of his wife and their seeming lack of passion, although this is open to interpretation. Others argue that it is simply a misunderstanding on Holden's part, and certainly Mr. Antolini is portrayed as a father figure for whom this might be a natural reaction. This would certainly follow the past few chapters where the reader finds more reliable information from other characters. Can you find any reason not to trust Mr. Antolini in this instance? This would demonstrate the level of Holden's paranoia and his fear of intimacy.-->

<p>When Holden is explaining to Mr. Antolini why he left Pencey, he gives the example of his Oral Expression class, where students are taught not to digress. The scene is intended as another example of how modern society restricts conversation. “[The speech] didn’t have to do with the farm-I admit it—but it was nice,” Holden comments, implying that not everything has to be unified and simplified. It represents Holden’s desire for freedom, .

<p>Mr. Antolini is intended as a foil to Phœbe. Unlike her, he is not a child and the wisdom he possesses is not a child's blunt observations. He understands Holden like Phœbe can’t—Phœbe can only make Holden understand himself. Because of his experience, he is capable of realizing that Holden’s sickness with human behavior is not an oddity to be eliminated so much as an idea which needs to be developed maturely.

<p>Mr. Antolini’s speech regarding the “terrible, terrible fall” to which Holden is headed is highly symbolic. The “fall” is intended to evoke the fall that Holden described earlier-that of children maturing. But here, the fall Mr. Antolini describes is one of Holden's waking up suddenly at thirty years old, and realizing what a waste he's made of life. In other words, the here the fall is one of largely having never grown up—the exact opposite of the one Holden describes. The implication is that Holden is misguided in his dream of being the catcher in the rye.

<p><!--The question and purpose of Mr. Antolini's sexuality is perhaps one of the most hotly discussed subjects about the book. Most critics agree that Mr. Antolini is indeed homosexual, but if so, the question is why? One answer assumes that the effect of Mr. Antolini's being “a flit” is more or less the diminished value of his (rather good) advice in Holden's mind. The question which Salinger forces us to ask is “Would Holden have been better off not knowing?” In other words, would it have been better for Mr. Antolini to be a phony, concealing his attraction to Holden? Holden's cry for integrity and being true to yourself clearly has a flip side.-->

<h2>Themes</h2>

<section class="pre"><h3>Alienation as a form of self-protection</h3>
Holden has gotten himself caught in a cycle of self-destruction: his fear of human contact leads to alienation, which leads to loneliness, which causes him to reach out to another person. Because he fears human contact, this leads to terrible experiences. This convinces him that people are no good, or phony which leads to his sense of alienation and loss of friends. 

<p>Holden has lost both his brothers, he does not see Phœbe often, and he does not want to see his parents and tell them that he flunked school. Allie, his younger brother died, and D.B. has left and gone to California. He feels very distant from D.B. because he thinks he is a sell-out, writing movie scripts instead of books. The two people Holden really needs in his life are gone.

<p>When Holden makes this statement, he means that once you get close to someone and depend on them for emotional support and you have a real connection, you can really miss that person, once they leave you as they always do. People leave, they die, and so, they are unreliable.

<p>Holden Caulfield is deeply affected by his alienation and isolation throughout the book. He does this not only because he feels he is not a phony, unlike the rest of the adult world but he doesn’t allow  himself to get close to others as a self-protecting mechanism so he cannot be hurt when they leave him. This is a result of the death of his younger brother, Allie, whom Holden was very close to.
</section>
<section class="pre"><h3>Painful Experience vs. Numbness</h3>
Perhaps the greatest theme of the novel involves the relationship between the pain of actual experience and feeling one's feelings, on the one hand, and on the other hand the equally devastating numbness that comes with shutting down one's emotions in order to avoid suffering. After the death of Allie, Holden essentially shuts down, forcing himself to lose all attachments to people so as never to be hurt again. He repeatedly mentions how important it is not to get attached to anyone, since this will lead to missing them once they are gone. By the end of the novel, he has spiraled so far down with this theory that he has become afraid to even speak to anyone. Phœbe is perhaps the only reminder that Holden still has the capacity to love. When he looks at her, he cannot help but feel the same tortured love that he felt for Allie. Nevertheless, the surges of these feelings leave him even more bereft. He knows he must leave Phœbe to protect himself, but when she shows up to accompany him on his journey, ultimately he puts his love for her first and sacrifices his own instinct to flee in order to return home. 

<p>Holden, it seems, is in the throes of an existential crisis. To a great degree he is numb to the pains and joys of life. Unable to come to terms with his brother's death, he has no one to show him the kind of parental or brotherly love that he himself gave Allie. Whenever someone does end up showing him even a hint of such love (such as Mr. Antolini), Holden ends up being disappointed.
</section>
<section class="pre"><h3>Loss of innocence</h3>
Holden must face that fork in the road of adolescence when one realizes that maturity entails a loss of innocence—that greater knowledge of oneself and others and the circumstances all comes with a price. In Holden's case, he cannot bear to accept the death of Allie, the death of pure innocence that had no good reason to suffer or die. In Holden's eyes, Allie is truth, while everyone else is “phony.” Innocence goes with idealism and a certain inability or unwillingness to bear and accept the harsher reality. Holden cannot bear to hold onto his innocence because innocence brings its own harms; people continue to disappoint him. Thus the cost of maturity is much less; innocence has been quite painful, too. Innocence has been problematic: the prostitute demands more money for nothing, the man who takes him in seems like a pedophile, and the cab drivers berate him as stupid when he asks simple questions about the birds in the park. While Allie’s memory can help him preserve his innocence, this is not enough, for he cannot find real love in the outside world. 

<p>Besides, losing Allie has brought tremendous pain. Holden also has the common adolescent experience of perceiving that time in school learning mundane lessons feels petty when his entire soul is in flux as it comes to grips with reality. When the entire world around him appears phony, where can he go to grasp hold of some reality, some stable truth? Without an explanation why Allie was taken from him, there appears no reason behind the world's events, and in this respect Holden’s maturity involves a deep loss of innocence such that he perceives that the reality of the world is its very irrationality.
</section>
<section class="pre"><h3>Lack of Authority</h3>
Holden seems to spend his whole life alone after Allie dies. His parents are absent, except for insisting that he stay in school, or go to a new school. At Pencey, Holden finds no adult to trust with his feelings, or even students; in his mind, most people everywhere are phony. Some adults even seem so selfish that they are willing to abuse children. Overall, Holden views adults with intense disappointment, even cynicism. How is it that the older they get, the farther from authenticity they get? Meanwhile, the gradual deterioration of the body disgusts him. Upon visiting an old professor, much of his thoughts are dedicated to the awfulness of the old man's body. There is no allure in growing older. 

<p>Authority does not seem related to wisdom, either. Adults tell Holden to find direction and thus stability, but he views such advice as both suspicious and naïve; playing such a game is inauthentic. Going his own way autonomously, as a law unto himself, does not work out so well either, so it is unclear where Holden might find legitimate authority.
</section>
<section class="pre"><h3>Loneliness</h3>
Holden is very lonely, and his adolescent loneliness seems to run much deeper than the feelings so commonly felt at that age. He admits to his loneliness openly, and it gives him evidence that perhaps he might still have some emotions left. At the same time, Holden takes few steps to mitigate his loneliness. Whenever he feels the urge to meet someone, to call up a girl, to have a social experience, he ends up sabotaging it before he can get hurt. He thus protects himself so fully that he effectively shuts off any possibilities of alleviating his own loneliness. He might want to call Jane, for example, but he hangs up before she gets on the phone. He might want to sleep with a prostitute to feel human comfort, but this will not do. He might want to interact with friends at a bar, but he ends up saying something hurtful so that they abandon him. Pushing them away provides a deeper and deeper loneliness, but at these moments of choice he is willing to endure it rather than eventually face the ultimate, devastating loneliness of losing another person like Allie.</section>
